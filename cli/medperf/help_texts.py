"""Help texts of the MedPerf CLI and web UI.

This module is the single source of truth for the help texts of CLI commands'
options and arguments. The web UI uses the same texts for its tooltips (the
module is available in the templates as `help_texts`), together with the
web-UI-only tooltips and form placeholders defined at the end of this file.

Usage:
